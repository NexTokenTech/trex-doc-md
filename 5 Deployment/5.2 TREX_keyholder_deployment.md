The deployment of a key-holder node suggests running a TREX node alongside the key-holder worker. If not, you need to know the IP address of a TREX node that accepts external WebSocket connections.

We suggest deploying key-holder nodes on Ubuntu 20.04 or Ubuntu 22.04. It needs [extra steps](https://medium.com/@yangfanghao/sgx-driver-and-sdk-installation-for-ubuntu-22-04-7db6c254e65c) to run a key-holder node Ubuntu 22.04.

# Local deployment
If you deploy the TREX key-holder on your local server, you may follow the markdown instruction in this [TREX Keyholder Repo](https://github.com/NexTokenTech/trex-keyholder).

Please modify the [config.yml](https://github.com/NexTokenTech/trex-keyholder/blob/main/service/src/config.yml) to configure the WebSocket connections to your local/external TREX node.

As mentioned in the Readme markdown, a CLI tool comes with the server program, and it helps the administrator to set up the TREX key-holder on-chain account and remote attestation.

The private key for the well-known account is stored in the [seed.yml](https://github.com/NexTokenTech/trex-keyholder/blob/main/service/src/seed.yml) for testing. It is not the private key for the key-holder signing any transaction or sending extrinsic.

# Cloud deployment
Here is an example of deploying a TREX key-holder on Azure cloud services.

## Prepare Intel SGX virtual machine
Please use [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/quick-create-marketplace) to create a VM on compatible cloud hosts.

Then, open the corresponding ports: `9933, 9944, 30333`. Use [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/nsg-quickstart-portal) as a reference.

Next, install Docker supports on this VM.
SSH into the VM:
```bash
ssh -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888 -I <ssh-path>/<ssh-file-name>.pem <azure-user-name>@$<vm-public-ip>
```
Use this [document](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) to install Docker.

Add users, $USER, to docker's user group. Use `newgrp docker` if the docker group does not show up.
```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

## Build and run key-holder node
Clone the [shell scripts](https://github.com/NexTokenTech/trex-keyholder-deploy) for building and running key-holder nodes.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NexTokenTech/trex-keyholder-deploy.git
cd trex-keyholder-deploy
```
Examine the TREX node IP and its port number in the `config.yml` and make sure that its WebSocket connection is enabled.

Then, for the first time, install all necessary dependencies and build the key-holder service.
The key-holder will connect to a TREX node (e.g. `--node_host=ws://127.0.0.1:9944`) by WebSocket protocol.
```bash
sudo /bin/bash build.sh --node_host=ip:port
```
To rerun the service:
```bash
sudo /bin/bash run_service.sh --node_host=ip:port
```
The keyholder's TEE (enclave) account is generated within the enclave, and its private key is protected. Therefore, it requires a CLI tool built alongside the service in the `/bin` to generate the account ID from the enclave as `tee_account_id.txt`.

The shell scripts use another CLI tool [TREX account funds](https://github.com/NexTokenTech/trex-account-funds) to send funds to the key-holder node for the first run since it requires a funded account to register the key-holder on the TREX network.
