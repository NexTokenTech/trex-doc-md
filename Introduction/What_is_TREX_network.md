# About TREX

TREX is the world’s first blockchain platform that enables decentralized timed-release encryption (dTRE) to unlock information (as serialized and structured data) and actions (as serialized procedures to be called in distributed remote nodes) for future events. 
The data and procedures were encrypted and distributed in a decentralized blockchain network. The data or procedure would be only revealed or executed after specific counts of clock ticks. 
It is a decentralized network that consists of validators, archivers, off-chain keyholders in a trusted execution environment (TEE), and other essential substrate nodes. Based on a monetary incentive mechanism, all nodes in the TREX network will collaborate and automatically adjust to ensure the accurate release of data and procedures as a consensus-based system.

The dTRE technology is enabled by combining the latest confidential computing hardware (Intel SGX technology) and blockchain technology. 
The data is encrypted with a symmetric encryption scheme and sent to random trusted off-chain keyholders for release. No third party has any early access to the encrypted contents.
The attacker must defeat security hardware to access encrypted data with unknown values. Therefore, we can build a decentralized reputation on the Polkadot-based blockchain ecosystem and security hardware backed by semiconductor giants (e. g. Intel). The dTRE technology provides content creators with a critical tool to monetize their [decentralized reputations](https://newsletter.thedefiant.io/p/-decentralized-reputation-is-about-a8b).

The emerging Web3 technology and ecosystems could enable enormous cross-chain applications which need time-sensitive and time-critical encryption of data and procedures, 
including DAO governance, DeFi applications, decentralized prediction market, and strategy market. The data and procedures must be confidential in many scenarios until release time. TREX and its blockchain application programming interface (API) could confidently empower the TRE applications on Web 3. With a blockchain-backed reputation system, it could terminate cheap talks and scams on today’s social networks and create new marketplaces for trading time-sensitive confidential data and procedures.

The TREX project roots a new family of Web3 applications aimed at institutional and business clients who need blockchain technology to enhance their data security and build reputations on Web3.
The TREX project was initialized to support an idea that needs immutable open records but is hidden until future events.
Applications like elections and blind bidding can be made on Web3 without dependency on centralized services. Our team believes that TRE will support a new type of Web3 application that accelerates the adoption of Web3.
