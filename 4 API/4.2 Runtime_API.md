The runtime API is the on-chain runtime logic, which writes the encrypted data into the blockchain as permanent records. It must be signed with a valid blockchain account and pay a fee to call the API before writing into the on-chain storage.
# Submit Encrypted Data
There are two protocols to submit timed-release encrypted data as extrinsic data to the TREX network: HTTP and Websocket.
It recommends using the [subxt](https://docs.rs/subxt/latest/subxt/)](https://docs.rs/subxt/latest/subxt/) library to generate, sign and encode extrinsic to HTTP endpoints.

We have a Rust example, which may be compiled into WebAssembly and called from JavaScript.
```rust
use subxt::{
    tx::PairSigner,
    OnlineClient,
    PolkadotConfig,
};
async fn submit_trex_data(cipher:Vec<u8>, 
                          release_time: u64, key_pieces: Vec<KeyPiece<AccountId>>) {
    let account_id = AccountKeyring::Alice.to_account_id().into();

    let signer = PairSigner::new(AccountKeyring::Alice.pair());

    let api = OnlineClient::<PolkadotConfig>::new().await?;

    let tx = trex_node::tx().trex_module().send_trex_data(account_id, cipher, release_time, key_pieces);

    let tx_submit_hash = api
        .tx()
        .sign_and_submit_default(&tx, &signer)
        .await?;

    println!("TREX extrinsic {:?} submitted",tx_submit_hash);
}
```
We provide example codes in this [Github Repo](https://github.com/NexTokenTech/trex-subxt).

Alternatively, you may use [substrate-API-client](https://github.com/scs/substrate-api-client) for WebSocket endpoints. The example is included in the [CLI code](https://github.com/NexTokenTech/trex-keyholder/blob/main/service/src/cli.rs) for the key-holder node.

You may also serialize the runtime API call and use it with JSON-RPC method `author_submitExtrinsic, params: Vec<String> (hex-encoded Request)`. The runtime method and its parameters are serialized as hex codes and sent as extrinsic.

Currently, the runtime API to submit encrypted data is only available to x86 environments. We are working on JavaScript API with WebAssembly libraries, so front-end users can directly submit encrypted data in browsers.
